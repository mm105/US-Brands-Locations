# US Brands Locations

This repository includes set of python scripts used to scrape store locations of some popular brands in United States of America. Each script iterate through dataset of US zipcodes (not available in this repository) and make API request for stores that are located within specific zipcode area. Most scripts use simple GET/POST request using python _requests_ library, but there are also few scripts that utilize _selenium_ and _beautiful soup_ libraries.

Store locations are scraped for following brands: Albertsons, Aldi, Bank of America Corp, Chase Bank, CVS Pharmacy, Dollar General, Kroger, Starbucks, Subway, Target, TD Bank, Walmart, Wells Fargo and Whole Foods Market.

Scripts are created as part of my internship task at [Social Explorer Company](http://socialexplorer.com/).
